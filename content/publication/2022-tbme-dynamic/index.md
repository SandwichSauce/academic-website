abstract: 'Objective: Brain-machine interfaces (BMIs) aim to provide direct brain
   control of devices such as prostheses and computer cursors, which have
   demonstrated great potential for motor restoration. One major limitation
   of current BMIs lies in the unstable performance due to the variability
   of neural signals, especially in online control, which seriously hinders
   the clinical availability of BMIs. Method: We propose a dynamic ensemble
   Bayesian filter (DyEnsemble) to deal with the neural variability in
   online BMI control. Unlike most existing approaches using fixed models,
   DyEnsemble learns a pool of models that contains diverse abilities in
   describing the neural functions. In each time slot, it dynamically
   weights and assembles the models according to the neural signals in a
   Bayesian framework. In this way, DyEnsemble copes with variability in
   signals and improves the robustness of online control. Results: Online
   BMI experiments with a human participant demonstrate that, compared with
   the velocity Kalman filter, DyEnsemble significantly improves the
   control accuracy (increases the success rate by 13.9\% in the random
   target pursuit task) and robustness (performs more stably over different
   experiment days). Conclusion: Experimental results demonstrate the
   superiority of DyEnsemble in online BMI control. Significance:
   DyEnsemble frames a novel and flexible dynamic decoding framework for
   robust BMIs, beneficial to various neural decoding applications.'


# Summary. An optional shortened abstract.
summary: A dynamic ensemble Bayesian filter (DyEnsemble) is proposed to improve the robustness of online brain-machine interface (BMI) control by adaptively combining multiple neural decoding models to handle neural signal variability, showing significantly better accuracy and stability than conventional methods.
