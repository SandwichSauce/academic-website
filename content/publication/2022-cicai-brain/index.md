abstract: Brain-computer interface (BCI) provides a direct pathway from the brain
   to external devices, which have demonstrated potential in rehabilitation
   and human-computer interaction. One limitation of current BCI lies in
   the low precision and stability in control, thus the user scenario and
   the interaction process play an important role in BCI applications. We
   propose to leverage the ability of artificial intelligence (AI) to
   improve the easy-of-use of BCIs. We designed a brain-controlled mahjong
   game with AI augmentation. As the user plays the game, an AI system
   continuously monitors the game and suggests several optimal candidate
   options, and the user directly selects from the candidates rather than
   from all the mahjong tiles in hand. This design enables the mahjong game
   with easy control, thus improving the user experience. Our system is
   evaluated by a human subject with an invasive BCI system. Results
   demonstrate that the subject can fluently control the system to play the
   mahjong game.


# Summary. An optional shortened abstract.
summary: CICAI | An AI-augmented brain-computer interface is developed for a mahjong game, enabling easier and more precise control by allowing users to select from AI-suggested options, thus improving usability and user experience in a real BCI application.
