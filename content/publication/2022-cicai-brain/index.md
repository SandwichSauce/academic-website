abstract: Brain-computer interface (BCI) provides a direct pathway from the brain
   to external devices, which have demonstrated potential in rehabilitation
   and human-computer interaction. One limitation of current BCI lies in
   the low precision and stability in control, thus the user scenario and
   the interaction process play an important role in BCI applications. We
   propose to leverage the ability of artificial intelligence (AI) to
   improve the easy-of-use of BCIs. We designed a brain-controlled mahjong
   game with AI augmentation. As the user plays the game, an AI system
   continuously monitors the game and suggests several optimal candidate
   options, and the user directly selects from the candidates rather than
   from all the mahjong tiles in hand. This design enables the mahjong game
   with easy control, thus improving the user experience. Our system is
   evaluated by a human subject with an invasive BCI system. Results
   demonstrate that the subject can fluently control the system to play the
   mahjong game.


# Summary. An optional shortened abstract.
summary: CICAI | An AI-augmented brain-computer interface is developed for a mahjong game, enabling easier and more precise control by allowing users to select from AI-suggested options, thus improving usability and user experience in a real BCI application.

🔶 Enhancing BCI-Based Human-Computer Interaction with AI: A Case Study in Mahjong Gaming 🔶

---

## 🧠 What is BCI?

**Brain-Computer Interface (BCI)** provides a **direct pathway** between the brain and external devices (e.g., computers, neuroprosthetics).  
- Enables **novel human-computer interaction**.
- Applications include:
  - 📝 BCI typewriters  
  - 🎮 BCI games

---

## ⚠️ Current Challenges in BCI

### 1. **Limited Bandwidth and Control Precision**
- **Non-invasive BCIs**: Can control robotic arms to track cursors, but bandwidth is limited.
- **Invasive BCIs**: Offer **higher bandwidth**, but still lag behind **natural motor control**.

### 2. **Signal Instability**
- **Neural signals are nonstationary**, causing **unstable control performance**.

---

## 🛠️ Efforts to Improve BCI Usability

### 🔡 Interface Design
- **Typewriter Interfaces**:
  - Example: *Hex-o-Spell* (Berlin BCI)  
    - Uses **hexagonal visual layout**.
    - Enhances **bandwidth and usability**.

### 🎮 Game-Based Interaction
- **Games tailored to BCI features** make control more natural and engaging.

### 🤖 AI Integration
- Recent studies incorporate **AI language models** to assist in **BCI-based communication**.

---

## 💡 Proposed Approach: AI-Augmented BCI Mahjong Game

### Objective
Enhance the **ease-of-use and experience** of BCI control in gaming.

### System Design
- **BCI Mahjong Game** + **AI Assistant**
- Instead of picking a tile directly, the system:
  - 📌 Suggests **optimal candidate options**.
  - ✅ User selects from these options—reduces fine control effort.

### Advantages
- 🎯 **Simplifies user operation**.
- 🙌 **Improves user experience**.
- 🎮 **Makes BCI gaming more accessible and enjoyable**.
