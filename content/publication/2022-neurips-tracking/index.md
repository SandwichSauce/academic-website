abstract: Neural signals are typical nonstationary data where the functional mapping between neural activities and the intentions (such as the velocity of movements) can occasionally change. Existing studies mostly use a fixed neural decoder, thus suffering from an unstable performance given neural functional changes. We propose a novel evolutionary ensemble framework (EvoEnsemble) to dynamically cope with changes in neural signals by evolving the decoder model accordingly. EvoEnsemble integrates evolutionary computation algorithms in a Bayesian framework where the fitness of models can be sequentially computed with their likelihoods according to the incoming data at each time slot, which enables online tracking of time-varying functions. Two strategies of evolve-at-changes and history-model-archive are designed to further improve efficiency and stability. Experiments with simulations and neural signals demonstrate that EvoEnsemble can track the changes in functions effectively thus improving the accuracy and robustness of neural decoding. The improvement is most significant in neural signals with functional changes.

# Coping with Neural Signal Nonstationarity in Brain-Computer Interfaces: The EvoEnsemble Approach

## üîÑ Background: Nonstationary Neural Signals

- **Nonstationarity** is a common characteristic in real-world signals.
- **Neural signals** are inherently nonstationary due to:
  - Internal neural dynamics
  - Synaptic plasticity driven by **learning** and **adaptation**
- This variability poses a **major challenge** to brain-computer interfaces (BCIs):
  - A fixed decoder may fail as **neural encoding functions evolve**
  - Leads to **degradation in decoding accuracy over time**

---

## üìò Neural Encoding as a Time-Varying Function

The neural encoding process can be formulated as:

$$
y_t = h_t(x_t) + q_t
$$

Where:
- \( y_t \): observed neural signal at time \( t \)
- \( x_t \): the state to be encoded (e.g., cursor velocity)
- \( h_t(\cdot) \): time-varying neural encoding function
- \( q_t \): noise term (biological or external)

Most traditional decoders (e.g., OLE, Kalman Filter) assume a **stationary** encoding function:

$$
h_t(\cdot) \equiv h_0(\cdot), \quad \forall t \in \{1, 2, 3, \ldots\}
$$

However, in **online BCI systems**, studies have shown that:
- \( h_t(\cdot) \) changes significantly over time
- These changes are influenced by **real-time feedback** (e.g., cursor velocity, control errors)
- Encoding function variability can occur **even within a single trial**

## ‚ùì Challenge: How to Handle Functional Changes?

### üõ†Ô∏è 1. Re-calibration-Based Solutions
- Periodic/manual **recalibration** of decoders
- **Brandman et al.**: Fast Bayesian recalibration (2‚Äì5s)
  - Eliminates open-loop phase
  - Still **interrupts user experience**
  - **Not responsive** to **short-term** signal changes

### ‚öôÔ∏è 2. Adaptive/Dynamic Model-Based Solutions

#### a. Dual State-Space Models (Wang et al.)
- Estimate both kinematics and tuning functions
- **Does not directly model neural variability**

#### b. DyEnsemble (Qi et al.)
- **Dynamic ensemble Bayesian filter**
- Maintains a **static model pool**
- Assembles decoder online via **Bayesian filtering**
- Handles **limited nonstationarity**
- Limited under **long-term continuous changes**

---

## üå± Proposed Solution: EvoEnsemble

We propose the **Evolutionary Ensemble Bayesian Filter (EvoEnsemble)**, treating neural functional changes as a **functional tracking problem**.

### üß† Key Ideas
- Maintains a **population** of candidate functions
- Uses **evolutionary computation** to adapt over time
- Computes fitness via **signal likelihood**
- Tracks time-varying functions using **Bayesian model averaging**
