abstract: In motor cortex, behaviorally relevant neural responses are entangled
   with irrelevant signals, which complicates the study of encoding and
   decoding mechanisms. It remains unclear whether behaviorally irrelevant
   signals could conceal some critical truth. One solution is to accurately
   separate behaviorally relevant and irrelevant signals at both
   single-neuron and single-trial levels, but this approach remains elusive
   due to the unknown ground truth of behaviorally relevant signals.
   Therefore, we propose a framework to define, extract, and validate
   behaviorally relevant signals. Analyzing separated signals in three
   monkeys performing different reaching tasks, we found neural responses
   previously considered to contain little information actually encode rich
   behavioral information in complex nonlinear ways. These responses are
   critical for neuronal redundancy and reveal movement behaviors occupy a
   higher-dimensional neural space than previously expected. Surprisingly,
   when incorporating often-ignored neural dimensions, behaviorally
   relevant signals can be decoded linearly with comparable performance to
   nonlinear decoding, suggesting linear readout may be performed in motor
   cortex. Our findings prompt that separating behaviorally relevant
   signals may help uncover more hidden cortical mechanisms.


# Summary. An optional shortened abstract.
summary: A framework is proposed to separate and analyze behaviorally relevant neural signals, revealing that previously overlooked neural responses encode rich information and suggesting that motor behaviors occupy a higher-dimensional space than expected and can be decoded linearly.
