summary: 'Leveraging the unique paradigm of Chinese character writing, this study uncovered a novel mechanism of sequential regulation in the brain’s encoding of complex motor sequences, based on activity in the human motor cortex. Building on this discovery, a state-dependent motor encoding and decoding model was developed, culminating in the creation of China’s first brain-controlled robotic arm system capable of writing Chinese characters.'
