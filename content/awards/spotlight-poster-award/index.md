title: SPOTLIGHT POSTER AWARD

event: The Chinese Conference on Brain-Machine Intelligence

location: Online
address:
  street: 450 Serra Mall
  city: Stanford

  postcode: '94305'
  country: United States

summary: Leveraging the unique paradigm of Chinese character writing, this study uncovered a novel mechanism of sequential regulation in the brain’s encoding of complex motor sequences, based on activity in the human motor cortex. Building on this discovery, a state-dependent motor encoding and decoding model was developed, culminating in the creation of China’s first brain-controlled robotic arm system capable of writing Chinese characters.
