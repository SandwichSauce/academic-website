    summary: |
      Leveraging the unique paradigm of Chinese character writing, this study uncovered a novel mechanism of sequential regulation in the brain’s encoding of complex motor sequences, based on activity in the human motor cortex. Building on this discovery, a state-dependent motor encoding and decoding model was developed, culminating in the creation of China’s first brain-controlled robotic arm system capable of writing Chinese characters.

    summary: |
      We demonstrated that the human motor cortex encodes complex handwriting movement by sequencing a small set of primitive states. The tuning function of neurons remains stable within states while varying largely among different states, which could be the key factor to inaccurate decoding. Based on this, we proposed state-dependent neural encoding and decoding computing models that better explained neural activities and handwriting trajectory decoding performance, enabling online decoding of recognizable Chinese characters.

    summary: |
      One critical problem in BCI systems is how to achieve robust control. The challenge lies in the variability of neural signals, that can be induced by: noises and variability of neural encoding associates with brain states. When neural signal changes, there can be decoding errors given a static neural decoder, exhibiting unstable BCI control. Ideally, a neural decoder should dynamically change along with changes in neural signals to achieve robust control. But how to achieve this? We propose a DyEnsemble model, which builds a pool of models to encode various neural functions, assigns the model weights dynamically according to the incoming neural signals, and assembles them in time with Bayesian model averaging rules. In this way, our decoder adjusts itself along with changes in neural signals.

## About Me

<!-- Chien Shiung Wu is a professor of artificial intelligence at the Stanford AI Lab. Her research interests include distributed robotics, mobile computing and programmable matter. She leads the Robotic Neurobiology group, which develops self-reconfiguring robots, systems of self-organizing robots, and mobile sensor networks. -->
Hi there! I’m a Ph.D. student at the College of Computer Science and Technology, Zhejiang University, where I’m fortunate to be advised by Prof. Yueming Wang. My research centers on invasive motor brain-computer interfaces (BCIs), with a focus on dynamic encoding and decoding of movement intention.

Before that, I received my Bachelor’s degree in Software Engineering from Northwestern Polytechnical University. I’ve been involved in building clinically oriented BCI systems, including China’s first closed-loop invasive BCI for cursor control and the world’s first BCI-powered robotic arm that writes Chinese characters.

Beyond research, I’m a big believer in living life to the fullest. I love trying out all kinds of new things—road trips, skiing, aerial photography, diving, baking, crafting, Chinese calligraphy and painting, even DIY home design. There's always something new to explore!

Let’s connect and make cool things happen!

<!-- 大家好！我是一名来自浙江大学计算机科学与技术学院的直博生，目前在王跃明教授的指导下，专注于侵入式运动脑机接口（BCI）领域，主要研究运动意图的动态编解码方法。

本科阶段我毕业于西北工业大学软件工程专业。读博期间，我参与构建了多个面向临床应用的脑机接口系统，包括国内首个闭环光标控制系统和全球首个可进行汉字书写的脑控机械臂应用。

科研之外，我热爱生活，也喜欢尝试各种新鲜事物：自驾游、滑雪、航拍、潜水、烘焙、手作、书画、家装……总有一件事，让生活充满惊喜！
