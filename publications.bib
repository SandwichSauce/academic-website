  abstract={Brain-computer interface (BCI) provides a direct pathway from the brain
   to external devices, which have demonstrated potential in rehabilitation
   and human-computer interaction. One limitation of current BCI lies in
   the low precision and stability in control, thus the user scenario and
   the interaction process play an important role in BCI applications. We
   propose to leverage the ability of artificial intelligence (AI) to
   improve the easy-of-use of BCIs. We designed a brain-controlled mahjong
   game with AI augmentation. As the user plays the game, an AI system
   continuously monitors the game and suggests several optimal candidate
   options, and the user directly selects from the candidates rather than
   from all the mahjong tiles in hand. This design enables the mahjong game
   with easy control, thus improving the user experience. Our system is
   evaluated by a human subject with an invasive BCI system. Results
   demonstrate that the subject can fluently control the system to play the
   mahjong game.},

  abstract = {In motor cortex, behaviorally relevant neural responses are entangled
   with irrelevant signals, which complicates the study of encoding and
   decoding mechanisms. It remains unclear whether behaviorally irrelevant
   signals could conceal some critical truth. One solution is to accurately
   separate behaviorally relevant and irrelevant signals at both
   single-neuron and single-trial levels, but this approach remains elusive
   due to the unknown ground truth of behaviorally relevant signals.
   Therefore, we propose a framework to define, extract, and validate
   behaviorally relevant signals. Analyzing separated signals in three
   monkeys performing different reaching tasks, we found neural responses
   previously considered to contain little information actually encode rich
   behavioral information in complex nonlinear ways. These responses are
   critical for neuronal redundancy and reveal movement behaviors occupy a
   higher-dimensional neural space than previously expected. Surprisingly,
   when incorporating often-ignored neural dimensions, behaviorally
   relevant signals can be decoded linearly with comparable performance to
   nonlinear decoding, suggesting linear readout may be performed in motor
   cortex. Our findings prompt that separating behaviorally relevant
   signals may help uncover more hidden cortical mechanisms.},
